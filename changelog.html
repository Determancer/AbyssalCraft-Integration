<ul>
	<li>Transmutator recipes can now be removed again (apparently broke at some point)</li>
	<li>Crystallizer recipes can now be removed again (TL;DR read thing about Transmutator recipes)</li>
	<li>Upgrade Kit recipes can now be removed again (roughly the same problem as the other cases, but a bit different)</li>
	<li>Bump to AbyssalCraft 1.9.4 (the now working recipe removal stuff is incompatible with the pre-releases)</li>
